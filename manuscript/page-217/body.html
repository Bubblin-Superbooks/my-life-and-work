We introduced a system by which the man at the furnace has nothing at
all to do with the heat. He does not see the pyrometer—the instrument
which registers the temperature. Coloured electric lights give him his

in detail before a move is made. Sometimes wooden models are constructed
or again the parts are drawn to full size on a blackboard. We are not
bound by precedent but we leave nothing to luck, and we have yet to
build a machine that will not do the work for which it was designed.
