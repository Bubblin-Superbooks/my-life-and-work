<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">work honours him.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">All of our people come into the factory or the offices through the
employment departments. As I have said, we do not hire experts—neither
do we hire men on past experiences or for any position other than the
lowest. Since we do not take a man on his past history, we do not refuse
him because of his past history. I never met a man who was thoroughly
bad. There is always some good in him—if he gets a chance. That is the
reason we do not care in the least about a man's antecedents—we do not
hire a man's history, we hire the man. If he has been in jail, that is
no reason to say that he will be in jail again. I think, on the
contrary, he is, if given a chance, very likely to make a special effort
to keep out of jail. Our employment office does not bar a man for
anything he has previously done—he is equally acceptable whether he has
been in Sing Sing or at Harvard and we do not even inquire from which
place</p></div> </div>
