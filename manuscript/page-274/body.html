<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>We have made changes in the system, but we have not deviated from this
principle:</p><p>If you expect a man to give his time and energy, fix his wages so that
he will have no financial worries. It pays. Our profits, after paying
good wages and a bonus—which bonus used to run around ten millions a
year before we changed the system—show that paying good wages is the
most profitable way of doing business.</p><p>There were objections to the bonus-on-conduct method of paying wages. It
tended toward paternalism. Paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare
work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of
date. Men need counsel and men need help, oftentimes special help; and
all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable
plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry
and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside.</p></div> </div>
