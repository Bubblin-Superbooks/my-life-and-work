<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Dividing and subdividing operations, keeping
the work in motion—those are the keynotes of production. But also it is
to be remembered that all the parts are designed so that they can be
most easily made. And the saving? Although the comparison is not quite
fair, it is startling. If at our present rate of production we employed
the same number of men per car that we did when we began in 1903—and
those men were only for assembly—we should to-day require a force of
more than two hundred thousand. We have less than fifty thousand men on
automobile production at our highest point of around four thousand cars
a day!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
