organized—the boys get only a smattering of knowledge and they do not
learn how to use that knowledge. The trade school should not be a cross
between a technical college and a school; it should be a means of
teaching boys to be productive. If they are put at useless tasks—at
making articles and then throwing them away—they cannot have the
interest or acquire the knowledge which is their right. And during the
period of schooling the boy is not productive; the schools—unless by
charity—make no provision for the support of the boy. Many boys need
support; they must work at the first thing which comes to hand. They
have no chance to pick and choose.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">When the boy thus enters life untrained, he but adds to the already
great scarcity of competent labour. Modern industry requires a degree of
