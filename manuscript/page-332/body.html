circumstances is their enemy. And many a business man thanks his stars
for the pinch which showed him that his best capital was in his own
brains and not in bank loans. Borrowing under certain circumstances is
just like a drunkard taking another drink to cure the effect of the last

profitable than any amount of new capital at 7 per cent.</p><p>The internal ailments of business are the ones that require most
attention. "Business" in the sense of trading with the people is largely
a matter of filling the wants of the people. If you make what they need,

then you will do business as long as there is business to do. People buy
what helps them just as naturally as they drink water.</p></div> </div>
