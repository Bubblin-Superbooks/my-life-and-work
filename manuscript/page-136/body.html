<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">advertisement for which we took
four pages in the principal newspapers all over the country. We set out
our case—we set out our confidence in victory—and in conclusion said:</p><p>In conclusion we beg to state if there are any prospective automobile
buyers who are at all intimidated by the claims made by our adversaries
that we will give them, in addition to the protection of the Ford Motor
Company with its some $6,000,000.00 of assets, an individual bond backed
by a Company of more than $6,000,000.00 more of assets, so that each and
every individual owner of a Ford car will be protected until at least
$12,000,000.00 of assets have been wiped out by those who desire to
control and monopolize this wonderful industry.</p><p>The bond is yours for the asking, so do not allow yourself to be sold
inferior cars at extravagant prices because of any statement made by
this "Divine" body.</p></div> </div>
