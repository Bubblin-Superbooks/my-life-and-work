and lightness were required. Of course they are not all the same kind of
vanadium steel. The other elements vary according to whether the part is
to stand hard wear or whether it needs spring—in short, according to
what it needs. Before these experiments I believe that not more than
four different grades of steel had ever been used in automobile
construction. By further experimenting, especially in the direction of
heat treating, we have been able still further to increase the strength
of the steel and therefore to reduce the weight of the car. In 1910 the
French Department of Commerce and Industry took one of our steering
spindle connecting rod yokes—selecting it as a vital unit—and tried it
against a similar part from what they considered the best French car,
and in every test our steel proved the stronger.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The vanadium steel disposed of much of the weight. The other requisites
