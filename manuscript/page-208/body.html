promoted, then there is no difficulty about promotion. The promotion
itself is not formal; the man simply finds himself doing something other

factory started as a machinist. The man in charge of the big River Rouge
plant began as a patternmaker. Another man overseeing one of the
principal departments started as a sweeper. There is not a single man
anywhere in the factory who did not simply come in off the street.
Everything that we have developed has been done by men who have
qualified themselves with us. We fortunately did not inherit any
traditions and we are not founding any. If we have a tradition it is
this:</p><p>Everything can always be done better than it is being done.</p></div> </div>
