<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">automobiles—they make it easy for others to produce them. Our
skilled men are the tool makers, the experimental workmen, the
machinists, and the pattern makers. They are as good as any men in the
world—so good, indeed, that they should not be wasted in doing that
which the machines they contrive can do better. The rank and file of men
come to us unskilled; they learn their jobs within a few hours or a few
days. If they do not learn within that time they will never be of any
use to us. These men are, many of them, foreigners, and all that is
required before they are taken on is that they should be potentially
able to do enough work to pay the overhead charges on the floor space
they occupy. They do not have to be able-bodied men. We have jobs that
require great physical strength—although they are rapidly lessening; we
have other jobs that require no strength whatsoever—jobs which, as far
as strength is concerned, might be attended to by a child of three.</p></div> </div>
