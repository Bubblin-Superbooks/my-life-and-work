life—enough of the competition which means effort and progress. It is
one thing for an organization to be working harmoniously toward one
object, but it is another thing for an organization to work harmoniously
with each individual unit of itself. Some organizations use up so much
energy and time maintaining a feeling of harmony that they have no force
left to work for the object for which the organization was created. The
organization is secondary to the object. The only harmonious
organization that is worth anything is an organization in which all the
members are bent on the one main purpose—to get along toward the
objective. A common purpose, honestly believed in, sincerely
desired—that is the great harmonizing principle.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I pity the poor fellow who is so soft and flabby that he must always
