parts as they were needed in exactly the same way that one builds a
house. When we started to make parts it was natural to create a single
department of the factory to make that part, but usually one workman
performed all of the operations necessary on a small part. The rapid
press of production made it necessary to devise plans of production that
would avoid having the workers falling over one another. The undirected
worker spends more of his time walking about for materials and tools
than he does in working; he gets small pay because pedestrianism is not
a highly paid line.</p><p>The first step forward in assembly came when we began taking the work to
the men instead of the men to the work. We now have two general
principles in all operationsâ€”that a man shall never have to take more
than one step, if possibly it can be avoided, and that no man need ever
stoop over.</p></div> </div>
