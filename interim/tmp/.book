The progress has been wonderful enough—but when we compare\nwhat we have done with what there is to do, then our past\naccomplishments are as nothing. When we consider that more power is used\nmerely in ploughing the soil than is used in all the industrial\nestablishments of the country put together, an inkling comes of how much\nopportunity there is ahead. And</p>",
  "page-10": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">now, with so many countries of the world\nin ferment and with so much unrest every where, is an excellent time to\nsuggest something of the things that may be done in the light of what\nhas been done.</p><p>When one speaks of increasing power, machinery, and industry there comes\nup a picture of a cold, metallic sort of world in which great factories\nwill drive away the trees, the flowers, the birds, and the green fields.\nAnd that then we shall have a world composed of metal machines and human\nmachines. With all of that I do not agree. I think that unless we know\nmore about machines and their use, unless we better understand the\nmechanical portion of life, we cannot have the time to enjoy the trees,\nand the birds, and the flowers, and the green fields.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I think that we have already done too much toward banishing the pleasant\nthings from life by thinking that there is some opposition between\nliving and providing</p>",

We waste so much time and\nenergy that we have little left over in which to enjoy ourselves.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Power and machinery, money and goods, are useful only as they set us\nfree to live. They are but means to an end. For instance, I do not\nconsider the machines which bear my name simply as machines. If that was\nall there was to it I would do something else. I take them as concrete\nevidence of the working out of a theory of business, which I hope is\nsomething more than a theory of business—a theory that looks toward\nmaking this world a better place in which to live. The fact that the\ncommercial success of the Ford Motor Company has been most unusual is\nimportant only because it serves to demonstrate, in a way which no one\ncan fail to understand, that the theory to date is right. Considered\nsolely in this light I can criticize the prevailing system of industry\nand the organization of money and society from the standpoint of one who\nhas not been beaten by</p>",
  "page-12": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">them. As things are now organized, I could, were\nI thinking only selfishly, ask for no change. If I merely want money the\npresent system is all right; it gives money in plenty to me. But I am\nthinking of service. The present system does not permit of the best\nservice because it encourages every kind of waste—it keeps many men\nfrom getting the full return from service. And it is going nowhere. It\nis all a matter of better planning and adjustment.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I have no quarrel with the general attitude of scoffing at new ideas. It\nis better to be skeptical of all new ideas and to insist upon being\nshown rather than to rush around in a continuous brainstorm after every\nnew idea. Skepticism, if by that we mean cautiousness, is the balance\nwheel of civilization. Most of the present acute troubles of the world\narise out of taking on new ideas without first carefully investigating\nto discover if they are good ideas. An idea is not necessarily</p>",
  "page-13": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">good\nbecause it is old, or necessarily bad because it is new, but if an old\nidea works, then the weight of the evidence is all in its favor. Ideas\nare of themselves extraordinarily valuable, but an idea is just an idea.\nAlmost any one can think up an idea. The thing that counts is developing\nit into a practical product.</p><p>I am now most interested in fully demonstrating that the ideas we have\nput into practice are capable of the largest application—that they have\nnothing peculiarly to do with motor cars or tractors but form something\nin the nature of a universal code. I am quite certain that it is the\nnatural code and I want to demonstrate it so thoroughly that it will be\naccepted, not as a new idea, but as a natural code.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The natural thing to do is to work—to recognize that prosperity and\nhappiness can be obtained only through honest effort.

All of which I conceive to be\nmerely elemental common sense.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I am not a reformer. I think there is entirely too much attempt at\nreforming in the world and that we pay too much attention to reformers.\nWe have two kinds of reformers. Both are nuisances. The man who calls\nhimself a reformer wants to smash things. He is the sort of man who\nwould tear up a whole shirt because the collar button did not fit the\nbuttonhole. It would never occur to him to enlarge the buttonhole. This\nsort of reformer never under any circumstances knows what he is doing.\nExperience and reform do not go together. A reformer cannot keep his\nzeal at white heat in the</p>",

He must discard all facts.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Since 1914 a great many persons have received brand-new intellectual\noutfits. Many are beginning to think for the first time. They opened\ntheir eyes and realized that they were in the world. Then, with a thrill\nof independence, they realized that they could look at the world\ncritically. They did so and found it faulty. The intoxication of\nassuming the masterful position of a critic of the social system—which\nit is every man's right to assume—is unbalancing at first. The very\nyoung critic is very much unbalanced. He is strongly in favor of wiping\nout the old order and starting a new one. They actually managed to start\na new world in Russia. It is there that the work of the world makers can\nbest be studied. We learn from Russia that it is the minority and not\nthe majority who determine destructive action. We learn also that while\nmen may decree social laws in conflict with natural laws, Nature vetoes\nthose laws</p>",
  "page-16": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">more ruthlessly than did the Czars. Nature has vetoed the\nwhole Soviet Republic. For it sought to deny nature. It denied above all\nelse the right to the fruits of labour. Some people say, \"Russia will\nhave to go to work,\" but that does not describe the case. The fact is\nthat poor Russia is at work, but her work counts for nothing. It is not\nfree work. In the United States a workman works eight hours a day; in\nRussia, he works twelve to fourteen. In the United States, if a workman\nwishes to lay off a day or a week, and is able to afford it, there is\nnothing to prevent him. In Russia, under Sovietism, the workman goes to\nwork whether he wants to or not. The freedom of the citizen has\ndisappeared in the discipline of a prison-like monotony in which all are\ntreated alike. That is slavery. Freedom is the right to work a decent\nlength of time and to get a decent living for doing so; to be able to\narrange the little personal details of one's own life. It is the\naggregate of these and</p>",

The Soviets are now\noffering the engineers, the administrators, the foremen and\nsuperintendents, whom at first they drove out, large sums of money if\nonly they will come back. Bolshevism is now crying for the brains and\nexperience which it yesterday treated so ruthlessly. All that \"reform\"\ndid to Russia was to block production.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There is in this country a sinister element that desires to creep in\nbetween the men who work with</p>",
  "page-18": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their hands and the men who think and plan\nfor the men who work with their hands. The same influence that drove the\nbrains, experience, and ability out of Russia is busily engaged in\nraising prejudice here. We must not suffer the stranger, the destroyer,\nthe hater of happy humanity, to divide our people. In unity is American\nstrength—and freedom. On the other hand, we have a different kind of\nreformer who never calls himself one. He is singularly like the radical\nreformer. The radical has had no experience and does not want it. The\nother class of reformer has had plenty of experience but it does him no\ngood. I refer to the reactionary—who will be surprised to find himself\nput in exactly the same class as the Bolshevist. He wants to go back to\nsome previous condition, not because it was the best condition, but\nbecause he thinks he knows about that condition.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The one crowd wants to smash up the whole world</p>",

The second notion arises as does the\nfirst—out of not using the eyes to see with. It is perfectly possible\nto smash this world, but it is not possible to build a new one. It is\npossible to prevent the world from going forward, but it is not possible\nthen to prevent it from going back—from decaying. It is foolish to\nexpect that, if everything be overturned, everyone will thereby get\nthree meals a day. Or, should everything be petrified, that thereby six\nper cent, interest may be paid. The trouble is that reformers and\nreactionaries alike get away from the realities—from the primary\nfunctions.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One of the counsels of caution is to be very certain that we do not\nmistake a reactionary turn for a return of common sense.

  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">anywhere. It was\na convention, not a march. Lovely things were said, but when we got home\nwe found the furnace out.

It can never\nbe more than a policeman, and so it is a waste of time to look to our\nstate capitals or to Washington to do that which law was not designed to\ndo. As long as we look to legislation to cure poverty or to abolish\nspecial privilege we are going to see poverty spread and</p>",

We may help the Government; the Government cannot help us.\nThe slogan of \"less government in business and more business in\ngovernment\" is a very good one, not mainly on account of business or\ngovernment, but on account of the people. Business is not the reason why\nthe United States</p>",
  "page-23": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was founded. The Declaration of Independence is not a\nbusiness charter, nor is the Constitution of the United States a\ncommercial schedule. The United States—its land, people, government,\nand business—are but methods by which the life of the people is made\nworth while. The Government is a servant and never should be anything\nbut a servant. The moment the people become adjuncts to government, then\nthe law of retribution begins to work, for such a relation is unnatural,\nimmoral, and inhuman. We cannot live without business and we cannot live\nwithout government. Business and government are necessary as servants,\nlike water and grain; as masters they overturn the natural order.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The welfare of the country is squarely up to us as individuals.

It does not matter whether industry is\nprivately managed or socially controlled; it does not matter whether you\ncall the workers' share \"wages\" or \"dividends\"; it does not matter\nwhether you regimentalize the people as to food, clothing, and shelter,\nor whether you allow them to eat, dress, and live as they like. Those\nare mere matters of detail. The incapacity of the Bolshevist leaders is\nindicated by the fuss they made over such details. Bolshevism failed\nbecause it was both unnatural and immoral.

If your researches do not give you that confidence, then keep\nright on searching until you find confidence. The place to start\nmanufacturing is with the article.

And so on through all of our materials\nand likewise with our parts. In the beginning we made very few of our\nparts and none of our motors.

What is\nthe use of putting a tremendous force behind a blunt chisel if a light\nblow on a sharp chisel will do the work? The chisel is there to cut, not\nto be hammered.

It is simpler than\nthe first car. But almost every point in it may be found also in the\nfirst car.

  "page-51": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">good idea to start\nwith, it is better to concentrate on perfecting it than to hunt around\nfor a new idea. One idea at a time is about as much as any one can\nhandle.</p><p>It was life on the farm that drove me into devising ways and means to\nbetter transportation. I was born on July 30, 1863, on a farm at\nDearborn, Michigan, and my earliest recollection is that, considering\nthe results, there was too much work on the place. That is the way I\nstill feel about farming. There is a legend that my parents were very\npoor and that the early days were hard ones. Certainly they were not\nrich, but neither were they poor. As Michigan farmers went, we were\nprosperous. The house in which I was born is still standing, and it and\nthe farm are part of my present holding.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was too much hard hand labour on our own and all other farms of\nthe time. Even when very young I suspected that much might somehow be\ndone in a</p>",
  "page-52": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">better way. That is what took me into mechanics—although my\nmother always said that I was born a mechanic. I had a kind of workshop\nwith odds and ends of metal for tools before I had anything else. In\nthose days we did not have the toys of to-day; what we had were home\nmade. My toys were all tools—they still are! And every fragment of\nmachinery was a treasure.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The biggest event of those early years was meeting with a road engine\nabout eight miles out of Detroit one day when we were driving to town. I\nwas then twelve years old. The second biggest event was getting a\nwatch—which happened in the same year. I remember that engine as though\nI had seen it only yesterday, for it was the first vehicle other than\nhorse-drawn that I had ever seen. It was intended primarily for driving\nthreshing machines and sawmills and was simply a portable engine and\nboiler mounted on wheels with a water tank and coal cart trailing\nbehind. I had seen plenty of these</p>",
  "page-53": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">engines hauled around by horses, but\nthis one had a chain that made a connection between the engine and the\nrear wheels of the wagon-like frame on which the boiler was mounted. The\nengine was placed over the boiler and one man standing on the platform\nbehind the boiler shoveled coal, managed the throttle, and did the\nsteering. It had been made by Nichols, Shepard & Company of Battle\nCreek. I found that out at once. The engine had stopped to let us pass\nwith our horses and I was off the wagon and talking to the engineer\nbefore my father, who was driving, knew what I was up to. The engineer\nwas very glad to explain the whole affair. He was proud of it. He showed\nme how the chain was disconnected from the propelling wheel and a belt\nput on to drive other machinery. He told me that the engine made two\nhundred revolutions a minute and that the chain pinion could be shifted\nto let the wagon stop while the engine was still running. This last is</p>",

It was not important with steam engines, which are\neasily stopped and started, but it became very important with the\ngasoline engine. It was that engine which took me into automotive\ntransportation. I tried to make models of it, and some years later I did\nmake one that ran very well, but from the time I saw that road engine as\na boy of twelve right forward to to-day, my great interest has been in\nmaking a machine that would travel the roads. Driving to town I always\nhad a pocket full of trinkets—nuts, washers, and odds and ends of\nmachinery. Often I took a broken watch and tried to put it together.\nWhen I was thirteen I managed for the first time to put a watch together\nso that it would keep time. By the time I was fifteen I could do almost\nanything in watch repairing—although my tools were of the crudest.\nThere is an immense amount to be learned simply by</p>",

It is not possible to learn from books how everything is\nmade—and a real mechanic ought to know how nearly everything is made.\nMachines are to a mechanic what books are to a writer.

I wanted to have something to do with machinery. My father was\nnot entirely in sympathy with my bent toward mechanics. He thought that\nI ought to be a farmer. When I left school at seventeen and became an\napprentice in the machine shop of the Drydock Engine Works I was all but\ngiven up for lost. I passed my apprenticeship without trouble—that is,\nI was qualified to be a machinist long before my three-year term had\nexpired—and having a liking for fine work and a leaning toward watches\nI worked nights at repairing in a jewelry shop.</p>",
  "page-56": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">At one period of those\nearly days I think that I must have had fully three hundred watches. I\nthought that I could build a serviceable watch for around thirty cents\nand nearly started in the business. But I did not because I figured out\nthat watches were not universal necessities, and therefore people\ngenerally would not buy them. Just how I reached that surprising\nconclusion I am unable to state. I did not like the ordinary jewelry and\nwatch making work excepting where the job was hard to do. Even then I\nwanted to make something in quantity. It was just about the time when\nthe standard railroad time was being arranged. We had formerly been on\nsun time and for quite a while, just as in our present daylight-saving\ndays, the railroad time differed from the local time. That bothered me a\ngood deal and so I succeeded in making a watch that kept both times. It\nhad two dials and it was quite a curiosity in the neighbourhood.</p>",
  "page-57": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In 1879—that is, about four years after I first saw that\nNichols-Shepard machine—I managed to get a chance to run one and when\nmy apprenticeship was over I worked with a local representative of the\nWestinghouse Company of Schenectady as an expert in the setting up and\nrepair of their road engines. The engine they put out was much the same\nas the Nichols-Shepard engine excepting that the engine was up in front,\nthe boiler in the rear, and the power was applied to the back wheels by\na belt. They could make twelve miles an hour on the road even though the\nself-propelling feature was only an incident of the construction. They\nwere sometimes used as tractors to pull heavy loads and, if the owner\nalso happened to be in the threshing-machine business, he hitched his\nthreshing machine and other paraphernalia to the engine in moving from\nfarm to farm. What bothered me was the weight and the cost. They weighed\na couple</p>",
  "page-58": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of tons and were far too expensive to be owned by other than a\nfarmer with a great deal of land. They were mostly employed by people\nwho went into threshing as a business or who had sawmills or some other\nline that required portable power.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Even before that time I had the idea of making some kind of a light\nsteam car that would take the place of horses—more especially, however,\nas a tractor to attend to the excessively hard labour of ploughing. It\noccurred to me, as I remember somewhat vaguely, that precisely the same\nidea might be applied to a carriage or a wagon on the road. A horseless\ncarriage was a common idea. People had been talking about carriages\nwithout horses for many years back—in fact, ever since the steam engine\nwas invented—but the idea of the carriage at first did not seem so\npractical to me as the idea of an engine to do the harder farm work, and\nof all the work on the farm ploughing was the hardest. Our roads</p>",
  "page-59": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">were\npoor and we had not the habit of getting around. One of the most\nremarkable features of the automobile on the farm is the way that it has\nbroadened the farmer's life. We simply took for granted that unless the\nerrand were urgent we would not go to town, and I think we rarely made\nmore than a trip a week. In bad weather we did not go even that often.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Being a full-fledged machinist and with a very fair workshop on the farm\nit was not difficult for me to build a steam wagon or tractor. In the\nbuilding of it came the idea that perhaps it might be made for road use.\nI felt perfectly certain that horses, considering all the bother of\nattending them and the expense of feeding, did not earn their keep. The\nobvious thing to do was to design and build a steam engine that would be\nlight enough to run an ordinary wagon or to pull a plough. I thought it\nmore important first to develop the tractor. To lift farm drudgery off\nflesh and blood</p>",
  "page-60": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">and lay it on steel and motors has been my most constant\nambition. It was circumstances that took me first into the actual\nmanufacture of road cars. I found eventually that people were more\ninterested in something that would travel on the road than in something\nthat would do the work on the farms. In fact, I doubt that the light\nfarm tractor could have been introduced on the farm had not the farmer\nhad his eyes opened slowly but surely by the automobile. But that is\ngetting ahead of the story. I thought the farmer would be more\ninterested in the tractor.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I built a steam car that ran. It had a kerosene-heated boiler and it\ndeveloped plenty of power and a neat control—which is so easy with a\nsteam throttle. But the boiler was dangerous. To get the requisite power\nwithout too big and heavy a power plant required that the engine work\nunder high pressure; sitting on a high-pressure steam boiler is not\naltogether pleasant. To</p>",
  "page-61": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">make it even reasonably safe required an excess\nof weight that nullified the economy of the high pressure. For two years\nI kept experimenting with various sorts of boilers—the engine and\ncontrol problems were simple enough—and then I definitely abandoned the\nwhole idea of running a road vehicle by steam. I knew that in England\nthey had what amounted to locomotives running on the roads hauling lines\nof trailers and also there was no difficulty in designing a big steam\ntractor for use on a large farm. But ours were not then English roads;\nthey would have stalled or racked to pieces the strongest and heaviest\nroad tractor. And anyway the manufacturing of a big tractor which only a\nfew wealthy farmers could buy did not seem to me worth while.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But I did not give up the idea of a horseless carriage. The work with\nthe Westinghouse representative only served to confirm the opinion I had\nformed that steam</p>",
  "page-62": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">was not suitable for light vehicles. That is why I\nstayed only a year with that company. There was nothing more that the\nbig steam tractors and engines could teach me and I did not want to\nwaste time on something that would lead nowhere. A few years before—it\nwas while I was an apprentice—I read in the <em>World of Science</em>, an\nEnglish publication, of the \"silent gas engine\" which was then coming\nout in England. I think it was the Otto engine. It ran with illuminating\ngas, had a single large cylinder, and the power impulses being thus\nintermittent required an extremely heavy fly-wheel. As far as weight was\nconcerned it gave nothing like the power per pound of metal that a steam\nengine gave, and the use of illuminating gas seemed to dismiss it as\neven a possibility for road use. It was interesting to me only as all\nmachinery was interesting. I followed in the English and American\nmagazines which we got in the shop the development of the engine and\nmost particularly the</p>",
  "page-63": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">hints of the possible replacement of the\nilluminating gas fuel by a gas formed by the vaporization of gasoline.\nThe idea of gas engines was by no means new, but this was the first time\nthat a really serious effort had been made to put them on the market.\nThey were received with interest rather than enthusiasm and I do not\nrecall any one who thought that the internal combustion engine could\never have more than a limited use. All the wise people demonstrated\nconclusively that the engine could not compete with steam. They never\nthought that it might carve out a career for itself. That is the way\nwith wise people—they are so wise and practical that they always know\nto a dot just why something cannot be done; they always know the\nlimitations. That is why I never employ an expert in full bloom. If ever\nI wanted to kill opposition by unfair means I would endow the opposition\nwith experts. They would have so much good advice that I could be sure\nthey would do little</p>",
  "page-64": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">work.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The gas engine interested me and I followed its progress, but only from\ncuriosity, until about 1885 or 1886 when, the steam engine being\ndiscarded as the motive power for the carriage that I intended some day\nto build, I had to look around for another sort of motive power. In 1885\nI repaired an Otto engine at the Eagle Iron Works in Detroit. No one in\ntown knew anything about them. There was a rumour that I did and,\nalthough I had never before been in contact with one, I undertook and\ncarried through the job. That gave me a chance to study the new engine\nat first hand and in 1887 I built one on the Otto four-cycle model just\nto see if I understood the principles. \"Four cycle\" means that the\npiston traverses the cylinder four times to get one power impulse. The\nfirst stroke draws in the gas, the second compresses it, the third is\nthe explosion or power stroke, while the fourth stroke exhausts the\nwaste</p>",
  "page-65": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">gas. The little model worked well enough; it had a one-inch bore\nand a three-inch stroke, operated with gasoline, and while it did not\ndevelop much power, it was slightly lighter in proportion than the\nengines being offered commercially. I gave it away later to a young man\nwho wanted it for something or other and whose name I have forgotten; it\nwas eventually destroyed. That was the beginning of the work with the\ninternal combustion engine.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I was then on the farm to which I had returned, more because I wanted to\nexperiment than because I wanted to farm, and, now being an all-around\nmachinist, I had a first-class workshop to replace the toy shop of\nearlier days. My father offered me forty acres of timber land, provided\nI gave up being a machinist. I agreed in a provisional way, for cutting\nthe timber gave me a chance to get married. I fitted out a sawmill and a\nportable engine and started to cut out and saw up the</p>",
  "page-66": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">timber on the\ntract. Some of the first of that lumber went into a cottage on my new\nfarm and in it we began our married life. It was not a big\nhouse—thirty-one feet square and only a story and a half high—but it\nwas a comfortable place. I added to it my workshop, and when I was not\ncutting timber I was working on the gas engines—learning what they were\nand how they acted. I read everything I could find, but the greatest\nknowledge came from the work. A gas engine is a mysterious sort of\nthing—it will not always go the way it should. You can imagine how\nthose first engines acted!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was in 1890 that I began on a double-cylinder engine. It was quite\nimpractical to consider the single cylinder for transportation\npurposes—the fly-wheel had to be entirely too heavy. Between making the\nfirst four-cycle engine of the Otto type and the start on a double\ncylinder I had made a great many experimental engines out of tubing. I\nfairly knew my way about. The double</p>",
  "page-67": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">cylinder I thought could be applied\nto a road vehicle and my original idea was to put it on a bicycle with a\ndirect connection to the crankshaft and allowing for the rear wheel of\nthe bicycle to act as the balance wheel. The speed was going to be\nvaried only by the throttle. I never carried out this plan because it\nsoon became apparent that the engine, gasoline tank, and the various\nnecessary controls would be entirely too heavy for a bicycle. The plan\nof the two opposed cylinders was that, while one would be delivering\npower the other would be exhausting. This naturally would not require so\nheavy a fly-wheel to even the application of power. The work started in\nmy shop on the farm. Then I was offered a job with the Detroit Electric\nCompany as an engineer and machinist at forty-five dollars a month. I\ntook it because that was more money than the farm was bringing me and I\nhad decided to get away from farm life anyway. The timber had all been\ncut. We rented a house on</p>",
  "page-68": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Bagley Avenue, Detroit. The workshop came\nalong and I set it up in a brick shed at the back of the house. During\nthe first several months I was in the night shift at the electric-light\nplant—which gave me very little time for experimenting—but after that\nI was in the day shift and every night and all of every Saturday night I\nworked on the new motor. I cannot say that it was hard work. No work\nwith interest is ever hard. I always am certain of results. They always\ncome if you work hard enough.

  "page-69": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">and the general construction, I could\ndraw on my experience with the steam tractors. In 1892 I completed my\nfirst motor car, but it was not until the spring of the following year\nthat it ran to my satisfaction. This first car had something of the\nappearance of a buggy. There were two cylinders with a two-and-a-half-inch\nbore and a six-inch stroke set side by side and over the rear axle. I\nmade them out of the exhaust pipe of a steam engine that I had bought.\nThey developed about four horsepower. The power was transmitted from the\nmotor to the countershaft by a belt and from the countershaft to the\nrear wheel by a chain. The car would hold two people, the seat being\nsuspended on posts and the body on elliptical springs. There were two\nspeeds—one of ten and the other of twenty miles per hour—obtained by\nshifting the belt, which was done by a clutch lever in front of the\ndriving seat. Thrown forward, the lever put in the high speed; thrown\nback,</p>",
  "page-70": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the low speed; with the lever upright the engine could run free.\nTo start the car it was necessary to turn the motor over by hand with\nthe clutch free. To stop the car one simply released the clutch and\napplied the foot brake. There was no reverse, and speeds other than\nthose of the belt were obtained by the throttle. I bought the iron work\nfor the frame of the carriage and also the seat and the springs. The\nwheels were twenty-eight-inch wire bicycle wheels with rubber tires. The\nbalance wheel I had cast from a pattern that I made and all of the more\ndelicate mechanism I made myself. One of the features that I discovered\nnecessary was a compensating gear that permitted the same power to be\napplied to each of the rear wheels when turning corners. The machine\naltogether weighed about five hundred pounds. A tank under the seat held\nthree gallons of gasoline which was fed to the motor through a small\npipe and a mixing valve. The ignition was by electric spark. The\noriginal</p>",
  "page-71": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">machine was air-cooled—or to be more accurate, the motor\nsimply was not cooled at all. I found that on a run of an hour or more\nthe motor heated up, and so I very shortly put a water jacket around the\ncylinders and piped it to a tank in the rear of the car over the\ncylinders. Nearly all of these various features had been planned in\nadvance. That is the way I have always worked. I draw a plan and work\nout every detail on the plan before starting to build. For otherwise one\nwill waste a great deal of time in makeshifts as the work goes on and\nthe finished article will not have coherence. It will not be rightly\nproportioned.

I ran\nthat machine about one thousand miles through 1895 and 1896 and then\nsold it to Charles Ainsley of Detroit for two hundred dollars. That was\nmy first sale.

  "page-75": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">some time later; the belts\nwere all right excepting in hot weather. That is why I later adopted\ngears. I learned a great deal from that car. Others in this country and\nabroad were building cars by that time, and in 1895 I heard that a Benz\ncar from Germany was on exhibition in Macy's store in New York. I\ntraveled down to look at it but it had no features that seemed worth\nwhile. It also had the belt drive, but it was much heavier than my car.\nI was working for lightness; the foreign makers have never seemed to\nappreciate what light weight means. I built three cars in all in my home\nshop and all of them ran for years in Detroit. I still have the first\ncar; I bought it back a few years later from a man to whom Mr. Ainsley\nhad sold it. I paid one hundred dollars for it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">During all this time I kept my position with the electric company and\ngradually advanced to chief engineer at a salary of one hundred and\ntwenty-five dollars a month.

I did not see the use of experimenting with\nelectricity for my purposes.

The automobile had passed from the initial\nstage where the fact that it could run at all was enough, to the stage\nwhere it had to show speed.

I designed a two-cylinder enclosed engine of\na more compact type than I had before used, fitted it into a skeleton\nchassis, found that I could make speed, and arranged a race with Winton.\nWe met on the Grosse Point track at Detroit. I beat him. That was my\nfirst race, and it brought advertising of the only kind that people\ncared to read. The public thought nothing of a car unless it made\nspeed—unless it beat other racing cars. My ambition to build the\nfastest car in the world led me to plan a four-cylinder motor. But of\nthat more later.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The most surprising feature of business as it was conducted was the\nlarge attention given to finance and</p>",
  "page-83": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the small attention to service.\nThat seemed to me to be reversing the natural process which is that the\nmoney should come as the result of work and not before the work. The\nsecond feature was the general indifference to better methods of\nmanufacture as long as whatever was done got by and took the money. In\nother words, an article apparently was not built with reference to how\ngreatly it could serve the public but with reference solely to how much\nmoney could be had for it—and that without any particular care whether\nthe customer was satisfied. To sell him was enough. A dissatisfied\ncustomer was regarded not as a man whose trust had been violated, but\neither as a nuisance or as a possible source of more money in fixing up\nthe work which ought to have been done correctly in the first place.

  "page-84": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">how much service it actually gave did not matter;\nand if it broke down and had to have parts replaced, then that was just\nhard luck for the owner.

The plan at that\ntime most in favor was to start off with the largest possible\ncapitalization and then sell all the stock and all the bonds that could\nbe sold.

Therefore they say that a proper charge against\nthe operating expenses of a business is the interest on this money. This\nidea is at the root of many business failures and most service failures.\nMoney</p>",
  "page-87": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">is not worth a particular amount. As money it is not worth\nanything, for it will do nothing of itself. The only use of money is to\nbuy tools to work with or the product of tools. Therefore money is worth\nwhat it will help you to produce or buy and no more. If a man thinks\nthat his money will earn 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, he ought to place it\nwhere he can get that return, but money placed in a business is not a\ncharge on the business—or, rather, should not be. It ceases to be money\nand becomes, or should become, an engine of production, and it is\ntherefore worth what it produces—and not a fixed sum according to some\nscale that has no bearing upon the particular business in which the\nmoney has been placed. Any return should come after it has produced, not\nbefore.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Business men believed that you could do anything by \"financing\" it.

  "page-88": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of \"refinancing\" was simply the game of sending\ngood money after bad. In the majority of cases the need of refinancing\narises from bad management, and the effect of refinancing is simply to\npay the poor managers to keep up their bad management a little longer.\nIt is merely a postponement of the day of judgment. This makeshift of\nrefinancing is a device of speculative financiers. Their money is no\ngood to them unless they can connect it up with a place where real work\nis being done, and that they cannot do unless, somehow, that place is\npoorly managed. Thus, the speculative financiers delude themselves that\nthey are putting their money out to use. They are not; they are putting\nit out to waste.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I determined absolutely that never would I join a company in which\nfinance came before the work or in which bankers or financiers had a\npart.

He has then only started with his customer. In the case of an\nautomobile the sale of the machine is only something in the nature of an\nintroduction.

  "page-90": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">was\nsomething more than a tendency in the early days of the automobile to\nregard the selling of a machine as the real accomplishment and that\nthereafter it did not matter what happened to the buyer. That is the\nshortsighted salesman-on-commission attitude. If a salesman is paid only\nfor what he sells, it is not to be expected that he is going to exert\nany great effort on a customer out of whom no more commission is to be\nmade. And it is right on this point that we later made the largest\nselling argument for the Ford. The price and the quality of the car\nwould undoubtedly have made a market, and a large market. We went beyond\nthat. A man who bought one of our cars was in my opinion entitled to\ncontinuous use of that car, and therefore if he had a breakdown of any\nkind it was our duty to see that his machine was put into shape again at\nthe earliest possible moment. In the success of the Ford car the early\nprovision of service was an outstanding element.</p>",
  "page-91": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">Most of the expensive\ncars of that period were ill provided with service stations. If your car\nbroke down you had to depend on the local repair man—when you were\nentitled to depend upon the manufacturer.

The\nrepair men were for a time the largest menace to the automobile\nindustry.

The use of the word \"standardizing\" is very\napt to lead one into trouble, for it implies a certain freezing of\ndesign and method and usually works out so that the manufacturer</p>",
  "page-105": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">selects\nwhatever article he can the most easily make and sell at the highest\nprofit. The public is not considered either in the design or in the\nprice. The thought behind most standardization is to be able to make a\nlarger profit. The result is that with the economies which are\ninevitable if you make only one thing, a larger and larger profit is\ncontinually being had by the manufacturer. His output also becomes\nlarger—his facilities produce more—and before he knows it his markets\nare overflowing with goods which will not sell. These goods would sell\nif the manufacturer would take a lower price for them. There is always\nbuying power present—but that buying power will not always respond to\nreductions in price. If an article has been sold at too high a price and\nthen, because of stagnant business, the price is suddenly cut, the\nresponse is sometimes most disappointing. And for a very good reason.\nThe public is wary. It thinks that the price-cut is a fake and it</p>",
  "page-106": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sits\naround waiting for a real cut. We saw much of that last year. If, on the\ncontrary, the economies of making are transferred at once to the price\nand if it is well known that such is the policy of the manufacturer, the\npublic will have confidence in him and will respond. They will trust him\nto give honest value. So standardization may seem bad business unless it\ncarries with it the plan of constantly reducing the price at which the\narticle is sold. And the price has to be reduced (this is very\nimportant) because of the manufacturing economies that have come about\nand not because the falling demand by the public indicates that it is\nnot satisfied with the price. The public should always be wondering how\nit is possible to give so much for the money.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Standardization (to use the word as I understand it) is not just taking\none's best selling article and concentrating on it. It is planning day\nand night and</p>",
  "page-107": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">probably for years, first on something which will best\nsuit the public and then on how it should be made. The exact processes\nof manufacturing will develop of themselves. Then, if we shift the\nmanufacturing from the profit to the service basis, we shall have a real\nbusiness in which the profits will be all that any one could desire.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">All of this seems self-evident to me. It is the logical basis of any\nbusiness that wants to serve 95 per cent. of the community. It is the\nlogical way in which the community can serve itself. I cannot comprehend\nwhy all business does not go on this basis. All that has to be done in\norder to adopt it is to overcome the habit of grabbing at the nearest\ndollar as though it were the only dollar in the world. The habit has\nalready to an extent been overcome. All the large and successful retail\nstores in this country are on the one-price basis. The only further step\nrequired is to throw overboard the idea of</p>",
  "page-108": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">pricing on what the traffic\nwill bear and instead go to the common-sense basis of pricing on what it\ncosts to manufacture and then reducing the cost of manufacture. If the\ndesign of the product has been sufficiently studied, then changes in it\nwill come very slowly. But changes in manufacturing processes will come\nvery rapidly and wholly naturally. That has been our experience in\neverything we have undertaken. How naturally it has all come about, I\nshall later outline. The point that I wish to impress here is that it is\nimpossible to get a product on which one may concentrate unless an\nunlimited amount of study is given beforehand. It is not just an\nafternoon's work.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">These ideas were forming with me during this year of experimenting. Most\nof the experimenting went into the building of racing cars. The idea in\nthose days was that a first-class car ought to be a racer. I never\nreally thought much of racing, but following the bicycle idea,</p>",
  "page-109": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\nmanufacturers had the notion that winning a race on a track told the\npublic something about the merits of an automobile—although I can\nhardly imagine any test that would tell less.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But, as the others were doing it, I, too, had to do it. In 1903, with\nTom Cooper, I built two cars solely for speed. They were quite alike.\nOne we named the \"999\" and the other the \"Arrow.\" If an automobile were\ngoing to be known for speed, then I was going to make an automobile that\nwould be known wherever speed was known. These were. I put in four great\nbig cylinders giving 80 H.P.—which up to that time had been unheard of.\nThe roar of those cylinders alone was enough to half kill a man. There\nwas only one seat. One life to a car was enough. I tried out the cars.\nCooper tried out the cars. We let them out at full speed. I cannot quite\ndescribe the sensation. Going over Niagara Falls would have been but a\npastime after a ride in one</p>",
  "page-110": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of them. I did not want to take the\nresponsibility of racing the \"999\" which we put up first, neither did\nCooper. Cooper said he knew a man who lived on speed, that nothing could\ngo too fast for him. He wired to Salt Lake City and on came a\nprofessional bicycle rider named Barney Oldfield. He had never driven a\nmotor car, but he liked the idea of trying it. He said he would try\nanything once.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It took us only a week to teach him how to drive. The man did not know\nwhat fear was. All that he had to learn was how to control the monster.\nControlling the fastest car of to-day was nothing as compared to\ncontrolling that car. The steering wheel had not yet been thought of.\nAll the previous cars that I had built simply had tillers. On this one I\nput a two-handed tiller, for holding the car in line required all the\nstrength of a strong man. The race for which we were working was at\nthree miles on the Grosse Point track. We kept our cars</p>",
  "page-111": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">as a dark horse.\nWe left the predictions to the others. The tracks then were not\nscientifically banked. It was not known how much speed a motor car could\ndevelop. No one knew better than Oldfield what the turns meant and as he\ntook his seat, while I was cranking the car for the start, he remarked\ncheerily: \"Well, this chariot may kill me, but they will say afterward\nthat I was going like hell when she took me over the bank.\"</p><p>And he did go.... He never dared to look around. He did not shut off on\nthe curves. He simply let that car go—and go it did. He was about half\na mile ahead of the next man at the end of the race!</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The \"999\" did what it was intended to do: It advertised the fact that I\ncould build a fast motorcar. A week after the race I formed the Ford\nMotor Company. I was vice-president, designer, master mechanic,\nsuperintendent, and general manager. The capitalization of the company\nwas one hundred</p>",
  "page-112": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">thousand dollars, and of this I owned 25 1/2 per cent.\nThe total amount subscribed in cash was about twenty-eight thousand\ndollars—which is the only money that the company has ever received for\nthe capital fund from other than operations. In the beginning I thought\nthat it was possible, notwithstanding my former experience, to go\nforward with a company in which I owned less than the controlling share.\nI very shortly found I had to have control and therefore in 1906, with\nfunds that I had earned in the company, I bought enough stock to bring\nmy holdings up to 51 per cent, and a little later bought enough more to\ngive me 58-1/2 per cent. The new equipment and the whole progress of the\ncompany have always been financed out of earnings. In 1919 my son Edsel\npurchased the remaining 41-1/2 per cent of the stock because certain of\nthe minority stockholders disagreed with my policies. For these shares\nhe paid at the rate of $12,500 for each $100 par and in all paid</p>",
  "page-113": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">about\nseventy-five millions.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The original company and its equipment, as may be gathered, were not\nelaborate. We rented Strelow's carpenter shop on Mack Avenue. In making\nmy designs I had also worked out the methods of making, but, since at\nthat time we could not afford to buy machinery, the entire car was made\naccording to my designs, but by various manufacturers, and about all we\ndid, even in the way of assembling, was to put on the wheels, the tires,\nand the body. That would really be the most economical method of\nmanufacturing if only one could be certain that all of the various parts\nwould be made on the manufacturing plan that I have above outlined. The\nmost economical manufacturing of the future will be that in which the\nwhole of an article is not made under one roof—unless, of course, it be\na very simple article. The modern—or better, the future—method is to\nhave each part made where it may best be made and then</p>",
  "page-114": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">assemble the\nparts into a complete unit at the points of consumption. That is the\nmethod we are now following and expect to extend. It would make no\ndifference whether one company or one individual owned all the factories\nfabricating the component parts of a single product, or whether such\npart were made in our independently owned factory, <em>if only all adopted\nthe same service methods</em>. If we can buy as good a part as we can make\nourselves and the supply is ample and the price right, we do not attempt\nto make it ourselves—or, at any rate, to make more than an emergency\nsupply. In fact, it might be better to have the ownership widely\nscattered.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I had been experimenting principally upon the cutting down of weight.\nExcess weight kills any self-propelled vehicle. There are a lot of fool\nideas about weight. It is queer, when you come to think of it, how some\nfool terms get into current use. There is the phrase</p>",
  "page-115": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">\"heavyweight\" as\napplied to a man's mental apparatus! What does it mean? No one wants to\nbe fat and heavy of body—then why of head? For some clumsy reason we\nhave come to confuse strength with weight. The crude methods of early\nbuilding undoubtedly had much to do with this. The old ox-cart weighed a\nton—and it had so much weight that it was weak! To carry a few tons of\nhumanity from New York to Chicago, the railroad builds a train that\nweighs many hundred tons, and the result is an absolute loss of real\nstrength and the extravagant waste of untold millions in the form of\npower. The law of diminishing returns begins to operate at the point\nwhere strength becomes weight. Weight may be desirable in a steam roller\nbut nowhere else. Strength has nothing to do with weight. The mentality\nof the man who does things in the world is agile, light, and strong. The\nmost beautiful things in the world are those from which all excess\nweight has been</p>",
  "page-116": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">eliminated. Strength is never just weight—either in men\nor things. Whenever any one suggests to me that I might increase weight\nor add a part, I look into decreasing weight and eliminating a part! The\ncar that I designed was lighter than any car that had yet been made. It\nwould have been lighter if I had known how to make it so—later I got\nthe materials to make the lighter car.</p><p>In our first year we built \"Model A,\" selling the runabout for eight\nhundred and fifty dollars and the tonneau for one hundred dollars more.\nThis model had a two-cylinder opposed motor developing eight horsepower.\nIt had a chain drive, a seventy-two inch wheel base—which was supposed\nto be long—and a fuel capacity of five gallons.

In 1879, when the application was filed, the automobile was\npractically unknown to the general public, but by the time the patent\nwas issued everybody was familiar with self-propelled vehicles, and most\nof the men, including myself, who had been for years working on motor\npropulsion, were surprised to learn that what we had made practicable\nwas covered by an application of years before, although the applicant\nhad kept his idea merely as an idea.

We entered cars in all of the races. We advertised\nand we pushed our sales. Outside of the simplicity of the construction\nof the car, our main difference in design was that we made no provision\nfor the purely \"pleasure car.\" We were just as much a pleasure car as\nany other car on the market, but we gave no attention to purely luxury\nfeatures.

There is a disposition to retire and\nretain control. It was, however, no part of my plan to do anything of\nthat sort. I regarded our progress merely as an invitation to do\nmore—as an indication that we had reached a place where we might begin\nto perform a real service. I had been planning every day through these\nyears toward a universal car. The public had given its reactions to the\nvarious models. The cars in service, the racing, and the road tests gave\nexcellent guides as to the changes that ought to be made, and even by\n1905 I had fairly in mind the specifications of the kind of car I wanted\nto build.</p>",
  "page-143": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">But I lacked the material to give strength without weight. I\ncame across that material almost by accident.</p><p>In 1905 I was at a motor race at Palm Beach. There was a big smash-up\nand a French car was wrecked. We had entered our \"Model K\"—the\nhigh-powered six. I thought the foreign cars had smaller and better\nparts than we knew anything about. After the wreck I picked up a little\nvalve strip stem. It was very light and very strong. I asked what it was\nmade of. Nobody knew. I gave the stem to my assistant.</p><p>\"Find out all about this,\" I told him. \"That is the kind of material we\nought to have in our cars.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">He found eventually that it was a French steel and that there was\nvanadium in it. We tried every steel maker in America—not one could\nmake vanadium steel. I sent to England for a man who understood how to\nmake the steel commercially. The next thing was to get a plant to turn\nit out. That was another problem. Vanadium</p>",
  "page-144": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">requires 3,000 degrees\nFahrenheit. The ordinary furnace could not go beyond 2,700 degrees. I\nfound a small steel company in Canton, Ohio. I offered to guarantee them\nagainst loss if they would run a heat for us. They agreed. The first\nheat was a failure. Very little vanadium remained in the steel. I had\nthem try again, and the second time the steel came through. Until then\nwe had been forced to be satisfied with steel running between 60,000 and\n70,000 pounds tensile strength. With vanadium, the strength went up to\n170,000 pounds.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Having vanadium in hand I pulled apart our models and tested in detail\nto determine what kind of steel was best for every part—whether we\nwanted a hard steel, a tough steel, or an elastic steel. We, for the\nfirst time I think, in the history of any large construction, determined\nscientifically the exact quality of the steel. As a result we then\nselected twenty different types of steel for the various steel parts.\nAbout ten of these were</p>",
  "page-145": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">vanadium. Vanadium was used wherever strength\nand lightness were required. Of course they are not all the same kind of\nvanadium steel. The other elements vary according to whether the part is\nto stand hard wear or whether it needs spring—in short, according to\nwhat it needs. Before these experiments I believe that not more than\nfour different grades of steel had ever been used in automobile\nconstruction. By further experimenting, especially in the direction of\nheat treating, we have been able still further to increase the strength\nof the steel and therefore to reduce the weight of the car. In 1910 the\nFrench Department of Commerce and Industry took one of our steering\nspindle connecting rod yokes—selecting it as a vital unit—and tried it\nagainst a similar part from what they considered the best French car,\nand in every test our steel proved the stronger.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The vanadium steel disposed of much of the weight. The other requisites\nof a universal car I had already</p>",
  "page-146": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">worked out and many of them were in\npractice. The design had to balance. Men die because a part gives out.\nMachines wreck themselves because some parts are weaker than others.\nTherefore, a part of the problem in designing a universal car was to\nhave as nearly as possible all parts of equal strength considering their\npurpose—to put a motor in a one-horse shay. Also it had to be fool\nproof. This was difficult because a gasoline motor is essentially a\ndelicate instrument and there is a wonderful opportunity for any one who\nhas a mind that way to mess it up. I adopted this slogan:</p><p>\"When one of my cars breaks down I know I am to blame.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">From the day the first motor car appeared on the streets it had to me\nappeared to be a necessity. It was this knowledge and assurance that led\nme to build to the one end—a car that would meet the wants of the\nmultitudes. All my efforts were then and still are turned</p>",
  "page-147": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to the\nproduction of one car—one model. And, year following year, the pressure\nwas, and still is, to improve and refine and make better, with an\nincreasing reduction in price. The universal car had to have these\nattributes:</p><p>(1) Quality in material to give service in use. Vanadium steel is the\nstrongest, toughest, and most lasting of steels. It forms the foundation\nand super-structure of the cars. It is the highest quality steel in this\nrespect in the world, regardless of price.</p><p>(2) Simplicity in operation—because the masses are not mechanics.</p><p>(3) Power in sufficient quantity.</p><p>(4) Absolute reliability—because of the varied uses to which the cars\nwould be put and the variety of roads over which they would travel.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">(5) Lightness. With the Ford there are only 7.95 pounds to be carried by\neach cubic inch of piston</p>",
  "page-148": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">displacement. This is one of the reasons why\nFord cars are \"always going,\" wherever and whenever you see\nthem—through sand and mud, through slush, snow, and water, up hills,\nacross fields and roadless plains.</p><p>(6) Control—to hold its speed always in hand, calmly and safely meeting\nevery emergency and contingency either in the crowded streets of the\ncity or on dangerous roads. The planetary transmission of the Ford gave\nthis control and anybody could work it. That is the \"why\" of the saying:\n\"Anybody can drive a Ford.\" It can turn around almost anywhere.</p><p>(7) The more a motor car weighs, naturally the more fuel and lubricants\nare used in the driving; the lighter the weight, the lighter the expense\nof operation. The light weight of the Ford car in its early years was\nused as an argument against it. Now that is all changed.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The design which I settled upon was called \"Model T.\" The important\nfeature of the new model—which, if</p>",
  "page-149": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">it were accepted, as I thought it\nwould be, I intended to make the only model and then start into real\nproduction—was its simplicity. There were but four constructional units\nin the car—the power plant, the frame, the front axle, and the rear\naxle. All of these were easily accessible and they were designed so that\nno special skill would be required for their repair or replacement. I\nbelieved then, although I said very little about it because of the\nnovelty of the idea, that it ought to be possible to have parts so\nsimple and so inexpensive that the menace of expensive hand repair work\nwould be entirely eliminated. The parts could be made so cheaply that it\nwould be less expensive to buy new ones than to have old ones repaired.\nThey could be carried in hardware shops just as nails or bolts are\ncarried. I thought that it was up to me as the designer to make the car\nso completely simple that no one could fail to understand it.</p>",
  "page-150": "<p>That works both ways and applies to everything. The less complex an\narticle, the easier it is to make, the cheaper it may be sold, and\ntherefore the greater number may be sold.</p><p>It is not necessary to go into the technical details of the construction\nbut perhaps this is as good a place as any to review the various models,\nbecause \"Model T\" was the last of the models and the policy which it\nbrought about took this business out of the ordinary line of business.\nApplication of the same idea would take any business out of the ordinary\nrun.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I designed eight models in all before \"Model T.\" They were: \"Model A,\"\n\"Model B,\" \"Model C,\" \"Model F,\" \"Model N,\" \"Model R,\" \"Model S,\" and\n\"Model K.\" Of these, Models \"A,\" \"C,\" and \"F\" had two-cylinder opposed\nhorizontal motors.

The largest\ncylinders were those of \"Model B.\" The smallest were in Models \"N,\" \"R,\"\nand \"S\" which were 3-3/4 inches in diameter with a 3-3/8-inch stroke.\n\"Model T\" has a 3-3/4-inch cylinder with a 4-inch stroke. The ignition\nwas by dry batteries in all excepting \"Model B,\" which had storage\nbatteries, and in \"Model K\" which had both battery and magneto. In the\npresent model, the magneto is a part of the power plant and is built in.\nThe clutch in the first four models was of the cone type; in the last\nfour and in the present model, of the multiple disc type. The\ntransmission in all of the cars has been planetary. \"Model A\" had a\nchain drive.</p>",
  "page-152": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">\"Model B\" had a shaft drive. The next two models had chain\ndrives. Since then all of the cars have had shaft drives. \"Model A\" had\na 72-inch wheel base.

In the first five\nmodels all of the equipment was extra. The next three were sold with a\npartial equipment. The present car is sold with full equipment. Model\n\"A\" weighed 1,250 pounds. The lightest cars were Models \"N\" and \"R.\"\nThey weighed 1,050 pounds, but they were both runabouts. The heaviest\ncar was the six-cylinder, which weighed 2,000 pounds. The present car\nweighs 1,200 lbs.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The \"Model T\" had practically no features which were not contained in\nsome one or other of the previous models.

It contained all that I was\nthen able to put into a motor car plus the material, which for the first\ntime I was able to obtain. We put out \"Model T\" for the season\n1908-1909.</p><p>The company was then five years old. The original factory space had been\n.28 acre. We had employed an average of 311 people in the first year,\nbuilt 1,708 cars, and had one branch house. In 1908, the factory space\nhad increased to 2.65 acres and we owned the building. The average\nnumber of employees had increased to 1,908. We built 6,181 cars and had\nfourteen branch houses. It was a prosperous business.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">During the season 1908-1909 we continued to make Models \"R\" and \"S,\"\nfour-cylinder runabouts and roadsters, the models that had previously\nbeen so successful, and which sold at $700 and $750. But</p>",
  "page-154": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">\"Model T\" swept\nthem right out. We sold 10,607 cars—a larger number than any\nmanufacturer had ever sold. The price for the touring car was $850. On\nthe same chassis we mounted a town car at $1,000, a roadster at $825, a\ncoupe at $950, and a landaulet at $950.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">This season demonstrated conclusively to me that it was time to put the\nnew policy in force. The salesmen, before I had announced the policy,\nwere spurred by the great sales to think that even greater sales might\nbe had if only we had more models. It is strange how, just as soon as an\narticle becomes successful, somebody starts to think that it would be\nmore successful if only it were different. There is a tendency to keep\nmonkeying with styles and to spoil a good thing by changing it. The\nsalesmen were insistent on increasing the line. They listened to the 5\nper cent., the special customers who could say what they wanted, and\nforgot all about the 95 per cent. who just bought without making any\nfuss. No</p>",
  "page-155": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">business can improve unless it pays the closest possible\nattention to complaints and suggestions. If there is any defect in\nservice then that must be instantly and rigorously investigated, but\nwhen the suggestion is only as to style, one has to make sure whether it\nis not merely a personal whim that is being voiced. Salesmen always want\nto cater to whims instead of acquiring sufficient knowledge of their\nproduct to be able to explain to the customer with the whim that what\nthey have will satisfy his every requirement—that is, of course,\nprovided what they have does satisfy these requirements.</p><p>Therefore in 1909 I announced one morning, without any previous warning,\nthat in the future we were going to build only one model, that the model\nwas going to be \"Model T,\" and that the chassis would be exactly the\nsame for all cars, and I remarked:</p><p>\"Any customer can have a car painted any colour that he wants so long as\nit is black.\"</p>",
  "page-156": "<p>I cannot say that any one agreed with me. The selling people could not\nof course see the advantages that a single model would bring about in\nproduction. More than that, they did not particularly care. They thought\nthat our production was good enough as it was and there was a very\ndecided opinion that lowering the sales price would hurt sales, that the\npeople who wanted quality would be driven away and that there would be\nnone to replace them. There was very little conception of the motor\nindustry. A motor car was still regarded as something in the way of a\nluxury. The manufacturers did a good deal to spread this idea. Some\nclever persons invented the name \"pleasure car\" and the advertising\nemphasized the pleasure features. The sales people had ground for their\nobjections and particularly when I made the following announcement:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"I will build a motor car for the great multitude. It will be large\nenough for the family but small enough for</p>",
  "page-157": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the individual to run and\ncare for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men\nto be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can\ndevise. But it will be so low in price that no man making a good salary\nwill be unable to own one—and enjoy with his family the blessing of\nhours of pleasure in God's great open spaces.\"</p><p>This announcement was received not without pleasure. The general comment\nwas:</p><p>\"If Ford does that he will be out of business in six months.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The impression was that a good car could not be built at a low price,\nand that, anyhow, there was no use in building a low-priced car because\nonly wealthy people were in the market for cars. The 1908-1909 sales of\nmore than ten thousand cars had convinced me that we needed a new\nfactory. We already had a big modern factory—the Piquette Street plant.\nIt was as good as,</p>",
  "page-158": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">perhaps a little better than, any automobile factory\nin the country. But I did not see how it was going to care for the sales\nand production that were inevitable. So I bought sixty acres at Highland\nPark, which was then considered away out in the country from Detroit.\nThe amount of ground bought and the plans for a bigger factory than the\nworld has ever seen were opposed. The question was already being asked:</p><p>\"How soon will Ford blow up?\"</p><p>Nobody knows how many thousand times it has been asked since. It is\nasked only because of the failure to grasp that a principle rather than\nan individual is at work, and the principle is so simple that it seems\nmysterious.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">For 1909-1910, in order to pay for the new land and buildings, I\nslightly raised the prices. This is perfectly justifiable and results in\na benefit, not an injury, to the purchaser. I did exactly the same thing\na few years</p>",
  "page-159": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">ago—or rather, in that case I did not lower the price as is\nmy annual custom, in order to build the River Rouge plant. The extra\nmoney might in each case have been had by borrowing, but then we should\nhave had a continuing charge upon the business and all subsequent cars\nwould have had to bear this charge. The price of all the models was\nincreased $100, with the exception of the roadster, which was increased\nonly $75 and of the landaulet and town car, which were increased $150\nand $200 respectively. We sold 18,664 cars, and then for 1910-1911, with\nthe new facilities, I cut the touring car from $950 to $780 and we sold\n34,528 cars. That is the beginning of the steady reduction in the price\nof the cars in the face of ever-increasing cost of materials and\never-higher wages.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Contrast the year 1908 with the year 1911. The factory space increased\nfrom 2.65 to 32 acres. The average number of employees from 1,908 to\n4,110, and</p>",

How did all\nthis come about?</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Simply through the application of an inevitable principle. By the\napplication of intelligently directed power and machinery. In a little\ndark shop on a side street an old man had laboured for years making axe\nhandles. Out of seasoned hickory he fashioned them, with the help of a\ndraw shave, a chisel, and a supply of sandpaper. Carefully was each\nhandle weighed and balanced. No two of them were alike. The curve must\nexactly fit the hand and must conform to the grain of the wood. From\ndawn until dark the old man laboured. His average product was eight\nhandles a week, for which he received a dollar and a half each. And\noften some of these were unsaleable—because the balance was not</p>",
  "page-161": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">true.</p><p>To-day you can buy a better axe handle, made by machinery, for a few\ncents. And you need not worry about the balance. They are all alike—and\nevery one is perfect. Modern methods applied in a big way have not only\nbrought the cost of axe handles down to a fraction of their former\ncost—but they have immensely improved the product.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was the application of these same methods to the making of the Ford\ncar that at the very start lowered the price and heightened the quality.\nWe just developed an idea. The nucleus of a business may be an idea.\nThat is, an inventor or a thoughtful workman works out a new and better\nway to serve some established human need; the idea commends itself, and\npeople want to avail themselves of it. In this way a single individual\nmay prove, through his idea or discovery, the nucleus of a business. But\nthe creation of the body and bulk of that</p>",
  "page-162": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">business is shared by everyone\nwho has anything to do with it. No manufacturer can say: \"I built this\nbusiness\"—if he has required the help of thousands of men in building\nit. It is a joint production.

By working and producing they make it possible for the\npurchasing world to keep coming to that business for the type of service\nit provides, and thus they help establish a custom, a trade, a habit\nwhich supplies them with a livelihood. That is the way our company grew\nand just how I shall start explaining in the next chapter.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the meantime, the company had become world-wide. We had branches in\nLondon and in Australia. We were shipping to every part of the world,\nand in England particularly we were beginning to be as well known as in\nAmerica. The introduction of the car in England was somewhat difficult\non account of the failure of the American bicycle. Because the</p>",
  "page-163": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">American\nbicycle had not been suited to English uses it was taken for granted and\nmade a point of by the distributors that no American vehicle could\nappeal to the British market. Two \"Model A's\" found their way to England\nin 1903. The newspapers refused to notice them. The automobile agents\nrefused to take the slightest interest. It was rumoured that the\nprincipal components of its manufacture were string and hoop wire and\nthat a buyer would be lucky if it held together for a fortnight! In the\nfirst year about a dozen cars in all were used; the second was only a\nlittle better. And I may say as to the reliability of that \"Model A\"\nthat most of them after nearly twenty years are still in some kind of\nservice in England.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In 1905 our agent entered a \"Model C\" in the Scottish Reliability\nTrials.

The Ford came through with only one involuntary\nstop against it. That started the Ford sales in England. In that same\nyear Ford taxicabs were placed in London for the first time. In the next\nseveral years the sales began to pick up. The cars went into every\nendurance and reliability test and won every one of them. The Brighton\ndealer had ten Fords driven over the South Downs for two days in a kind\nof steeplechase and every one of them came through. As a result six\nhundred cars were sold that year.

I cannot see how under such conditions the men could\npossibly be paid more than ten or twenty cents a day—for of course it\nis not the employer who pays wages. He only handles the money.

The rank and file of men\ncome to us unskilled; they learn their jobs within a few hours or a few\ndays. If they do not learn within that time they will never be of any\nuse to us. These men are, many of them, foreigners, and all that is\nrequired before they are taken on is that they should be potentially\nable to do enough work to pay the overhead charges on the floor space\nthey occupy. They do not have to be able-bodied men.

  "page-172": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">brought to it the\nparts as they were needed in exactly the same way that one builds a\nhouse. When we started to make parts it was natural to create a single\ndepartment of the factory to make that part, but usually one workman\nperformed all of the operations necessary on a small part. The rapid\npress of production made it necessary to devise plans of production that\nwould avoid having the workers falling over one another.

  "page-173": "<p>The principles of assembly are these:</p><p>(1) Place the tools and the men in the sequence of the operation so that\neach component part shall travel the least possible distance while in\nthe process of finishing.</p><p>(2) Use work slides or some other form of carrier so that when a workman\ncompletes his operation, he drops the part always in the same\nplace—which place must always be the most convenient place to his\nhand—and if possible have gravity carry the part to the next workman\nfor his operation.</p><p>(3) Use sliding assembling lines by which the parts to be assembled are\ndelivered at convenient distances.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The net result of the application of these principles is the reduction\nof the necessity for thought on the part of the worker and the reduction\nof his movements to a minimum.

  "page-174": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">is, from the\npoint of view of the non-mechanical mind, our most interesting and\nperhaps best known operation, and at one time it was an exceedingly\nimportant operation.

  "page-175": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">thirty-five to forty pieces in a nine-hour day, or about twenty\nminutes to an assembly. What he did alone was then spread into\ntwenty-nine operations; that cut down the assembly time to thirteen\nminutes, ten seconds. Then we raised the height of the line eight\ninches—this was in 1914—and cut the time to seven minutes. Further\nexperimenting with the speed that the work should move at cut the time\ndown to five minutes. In short, the result is this: by the aid of\nscientific study one man is now able to do somewhat more than four did\nonly a comparatively few years ago. That line established the efficiency\nof the method and we now use it everywhere. The assembling of the motor,\nformerly done by one man, is now divided into eighty-four\noperations—those men do the work that three times their number formerly\ndid. In a short time we tried out the plan on the chassis.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">About the best we had done in stationary chassis</p>",

We tried\nthe experiment of drawing the chassis with a rope and windlass down a\nline two hundred fifty feet long. Six assemblers traveled with the\nchassis and picked up the parts from piles placed along the line. This\nrough experiment reduced the time to five hours fifty minutes per\nchassis. In the early part of 1914 we elevated the assembly line. We had\nadopted the policy of \"man-high\" work; we had one line twenty-six and\nthree quarter inches and another twenty-four and one half inches from\nthe floor—to suit squads of different heights. The waist-high\narrangement and a further subdivision of work so that each man had fewer\nmovements cut down the labour time per chassis to one hour thirty-three\nminutes.

The speed of the moving work had to be carefully tried out;\nin the fly-wheel magneto we first had a speed of sixty inches per\nminute. That was too fast. Then we tried eighteen inches per minute.\nThat was too slow. Finally we settled on forty-four inches per minute.\nThe idea is that a man must not be hurried in his work—he must have\nevery second necessary but not a single unnecessary second. We have\nworked out speeds for each assembly, for the success of the chassis\nassembly caused us gradually to overhaul our entire method of\nmanufacturing and to put all assembling in mechanically driven lines.\nThe chassis assembling line, for instance, goes at a pace of six feet\nper minute; the front axle assembly line goes at one hundred eighty-nine\ninches per minute. In the chassis assembling are forty-five separate\noperations or stations.</p>",

The man who puts in a\nbolt does not put on the nut; the man who puts on the nut does not\ntighten it. On operation number thirty-four the budding motor gets its\ngasoline; it has previously received lubrication; on operation number\nforty-four the radiator is filled with water, and on operation number\nforty-five the car drives out onto John R. Street.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Essentially the same ideas have been applied to the assembling of the\nmotor.

  "page-179": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">hours and fifty-six\nminutes. Every piece of work in the shops moves; it may move on hooks on\noverhead chains going to assembly in the exact order in which the parts\nare required; it may travel on a moving platform, or it may go by\ngravity, but the point is that there is no lifting or trucking of\nanything other than materials. Materials are brought in on small trucks\nor trailers operated by cut-down Ford chassis, which are sufficiently\nmobile and quick to get in and out of any aisle where they may be\nrequired to go. No workman has anything to do with moving or lifting\nanything. That is all in a separate department—the department of\ntransportation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">We started assembling a motor car in a single factory.

  "page-180": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">A department is a little factory\nin itself.

It was only because of\ntransport ease that the departments were grouped together when we\nstarted to manufacture. I did not know that such minute divisions would\nbe possible; but as our production grew and departments multiplied, we\nactually changed from making automobiles to making parts. Then we found\nthat we had made another new discovery, which was that by no means all\nof the parts had to be made in one factory. It was not really a\ndiscovery—it was something in the nature of going around in a circle to\nmy first manufacturing when I bought the motors and probably ninety per\ncent. of the parts.

I hope that in the course of time the big Highland Park plant will\nbe doing only one or two things. The casting has already been taken away\nfrom it and has gone to the River Rouge plant.

The metal is poured at another point as\nthe work moves, and by the time the mould in which the metal has been\npoured reaches the terminal, it is cool enough to start on its automatic\nway to cleaning, machining, and assembling.

Before then we had had\nsome profit sharing. We had at the end of each year, for some years\npast, divided a percentage of our earnings with the employees. For\ninstance, as long ago as 1909 we distributed eighty thousand dollars on\nthe basis of years of service. A one-year man received 5 per cent. of\nhis year's wages; a two-year man, 7-1/2 per cent., and a three-year man,\n10 per cent. The objection to that plan</p>",
  "page-264": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was that it had no direct\nconnection with the day's work.

Therefore, starting\nabout 1913 we had time studies made of all the thousands of operations\nin the shops. By a time study it is possible theoretically to determine\nwhat a man's output should be.

  "page-266": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">into operation in\nJanuary, 1914, a kind of profit-sharing plan in which the minimum wage\nfor any class of work and under certain conditions was five dollars a\nday. At the same time we reduced the working day to eight hours—it had\nbeen nine—and the week to forty-eight hours. This was entirely a\nvoluntary act. All of our wage rates have been voluntary. It was to our\nway of thinking an act of social justice, and in the last analysis we\ndid it for our own satisfaction of mind. There is a pleasure in feeling\nthat you have made others happy—that you have lessened in some degree\nthe burdens of your fellow-men—that you have provided a margin out of\nwhich may be had pleasure and saving. Good-will is one of the few really\nimportant assets of life. A determined man can win almost anything that\nhe goes after, but unless, in his getting, he gains good will he has not\nprofited much.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was, however, no charity in any way involved.</p>",
  "page-267": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">That was not\ngenerally understood.

The plan\nwas to distribute profits, but instead of waiting until the profits had\nbeen earned—to approximate them in advance and to add them, under\ncertain conditions, to the wages of those persons who had been in the\nemploy of the company for six months or more. It was classified\nparticipation among three classes of employees:</p><p>(1) Married men living with and taking good care of their families.</p><p>(2) Single men over twenty-two years of age who are of proved thrifty\n   habits.</p><p>(3) Young men under twenty-two years of age, and women who are the sole\nsupport of some next of kin.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A man was first to be paid his just wages—which were then on an average\nof about fifteen per cent. above the usual market wage. He was then\neligible to a certain</p>",
  "page-269": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">profit. His wages plus his profit were calculated\nto give a minimum daily income of five dollars. The profit sharing rate\nwas divided on an hour basis and was credited to the hourly wage rate,\nso as to give those receiving the lowest hourly rate the largest\nproportion of profits. It was paid every two weeks with the wages. For\nexample, a man who received thirty-four cents an hour had a profit rate\nof twenty-eight and one half cents an hour—which would give him a daily\nincome of five dollars. A man receiving fifty-four cents an hour would\nhave a profit rate of twenty-one cents an hour—which would give him a\ndaily income of six dollars.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">It was a sort of prosperity-sharing plan.

  "page-270": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">readjusted. But in the beginning\nthe idea was that there should be a very definite incentive to better\nliving and that the very best incentive was a money premium on proper\nliving. A man who is living aright will do his work aright. And then,\ntoo, we wanted to avoid the possibility of lowering the standard of\nwork through an increased wage. It was demonstrated in war time that\ntoo quickly increasing a man's pay sometimes increases only his\ncupidity and therefore decreases his earning power. If, in the\nbeginning, we had simply put the increase in the pay envelopes, then\nvery likely the work standards would have broken down. The pay of\nabout half the men was doubled in the new plan; it might have been\ntaken as \"easy money.\" The thought of easy money breaks down work.\nThere is a danger in too rapidly raising the pay of any man—whether\nhe previously received one dollar or one hundred dollars a day. In\nfact, if the salary of a hundred-dollar-a-day man were</p>",
  "page-271": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">increased\novernight to three hundred dollars a day he would probably make a\nbigger fool of himself than the working man whose pay is increased\nfrom one dollar to three dollars an hour. The man with the larger\namount of money has larger opportunity to make a fool of himself.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In this first plan the standards insisted upon were not petty—although\nsometimes they may have been administered in a petty fashion. We had\nabout fifty investigators in the Social Department; the standard of\ncommon sense among them was very high indeed, but it is impossible to\nassemble fifty men equally endowed with common sense. They erred at\ntimes—one always hears about the errors. It was expected that in order\nto receive the bonus married men should live with and take proper care\nof their families. We had to break up the evil custom among many of the\nforeign workers of taking in boarders—of regarding their homes</p>",
  "page-272": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">as\nsomething to make money out of rather than as a place to live in. Boys\nunder eighteen received a bonus if they supported the next of kin.\nSingle men who lived wholesomely shared. The best evidence that the plan\nwas essentially beneficial is the record. When the plan went into\neffect, 60 per cent. of the workers immediately qualified to share; at\nthe end of six months 78 per cent. were sharing, and at the end of one\nyear 87 per cent. Within a year and one half only a fraction of one per\ncent. failed to share.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The large wage had other results. In 1914, when the first plan went into\neffect, we had 14,000 employees and it had been necessary to hire at the\nrate of about 53,000 a year in order to keep a constant force of 14,000.\nIn 1915 we had to hire only 6,508 men and the majority of these new men\nwere taken on because of the growth of the business.

  "page-273": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of nearly 200,000 men a year—which would be pretty nearly an\nimpossible proposition. Even with the minimum of instruction that is\nrequired to master almost any job in our place, we cannot take on a new\nstaff each morning, or each week, or each month; for, although a man may\nqualify for acceptable work at an acceptable rate of speed within two or\nthree days, he will be able to do more after a year's experience than he\ndid at the beginning. The matter of labour turnover has not since\nbothered us; it is rather hard to give exact figures because when we are\nnot running to capacity, we rotate some of the men in order to\ndistribute the work among greatest number. This makes it hard to\ndistinguish between the voluntary and involuntary exits. To-day we keep\nno figures; we now think so little of our turnover that we do not bother\nto keep records. As far as we know the turnover is somewhere between 3\nper cent. and 6 per cent. a month.</p>",

Reducing prices is taken by the\nshort-sighted to be the same as reducing the income of a business. It is\nvery difficult to deal with that sort of a mind because it is so totally\nlacking in even the background knowledge of what business is. For\ninstance, I was once asked, when contemplating a reduction of eighty\ndollars a car, whether on a production of five hundred thousand cars\nthis would</p>",
  "page-336": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">not reduce the income of the company by forty million\ndollars.

Reducing prices increases the volume and disposes of\nfinance, provided one regards the inevitable profit as a trust fund with\nwhich to conduct more and better business. Our profit, because of the\nrapidity of the turnover in the business and the great volume of sales,\nhas, no matter what the price at which the product was sold, always been\nlarge. We have had a small profit per article but a large aggregate\nprofit. The profit is not constant. After cutting the prices, the\nprofits for a time run low, but then the inevitable economies begin to\nget in their work and the profits go high again. But they are not\ndistributed as dividends. I have always insisted on the payment of small\ndividends and the company has to-day no stockholders who wanted a\ndifferent policy.

During one year\nour profits were so much larger than we expected them to be that we\nvoluntarily returned fifty dollars to each purchaser of a car.

It is inevitable that any\none who can borrow freely to cover errors of management will borrow\nrather than correct the errors. Our railway managers have been\npractically forced to borrow, for since the very inception of the\nrailways they have not been free agents. The guiding hand of the railway\nhas been, not the railroad man, but the banker. When railroad credit was\nhigh, more money was to be made out of floating bond issues and\nspeculating in the securities than out of service to the public. A very\nsmall fraction of the money earned by the railways has gone back into\nthe rehabilitation of</p>",
  "page-464": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the properties. When by skilled management the net\nrevenue became large enough to pay a considerable dividend upon the\nstock, then that dividend was used first by the speculators on the\ninside and controlling the railroad fiscal policy to boom the stock and\nunload their holdings, and then to float a bond issue on the strength of\nthe credit gained through the earnings. When the earnings dropped or\nwere artificially depressed, then the speculators bought back the stock\nand in the course of time staged another advance and unloading. There is\nscarcely a railroad in the United States that has not been through one\nor more receiverships, due to the fact that the financial interests\npiled on load after load of securities until the structures grew\ntopheavy and fell over.

And because railway financing began in one\nof the rottenest periods of our business history, a number of practices\nwere established as precedents which have influenced railway work ever\nsince. One of the first things the railways did was to throttle all\nother methods of transportation. There was the beginning of a splendid\ncanal system in this country and a great movement for</p>",
  "page-477": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">canalization was\nat its height. The railroad companies bought out the canal companies and\nlet the canals fill up and choke with weeds and refuse.

  "page-478": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">publics.\nBusiness was treated as if it existed for the benefit of the railways.\nDuring this period of folly, it was not good railroading to get goods\nfrom their shipping point to their destination by the most direct line\npossible, but to keep them on the road as long as possible, send them\naround the longest way, give as many connecting lines as possible a\npiece of the profit, and let the public stand the resulting loss of time\nand money. That was once counted good railroading. It has not entirely\npassed out of practice to-day.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One of the great changes in our economic life to which this railroad\npolicy contributed was the centralization of certain activities, not\nbecause centralization was necessary, nor because it contributed to the\nwell-being of the people, but because, among other things, it made\ndouble business for the railroads.

  "page-479": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">the\ncattle are drawn from; and then if you consider that the cattle, when\nconverted into food, are hauled again by the same railways right back to\nthe place where they came from, you will get some sidelight on the\ntransportation problem and the price of meat. Take also grain. Every\nreader of advertisements knows where the great flour mills of the\ncountry are located. And they probably know also that these great mills\nare not located in the sections where the grain of the United States is\nraised. There are staggering quantities of grain, thousands of\ntrainloads, hauled uselessly long distances, and then in the form of\nflour hauled back again long distances to the states and sections where\nthe grain was raised—a burdening of the railroads which is of no\nbenefit to the communities where the grain originated, nor to any one\nelse except the monopolistic mills and the railroads.

On meat\nand grain and perhaps on cotton, too, the transportation burden could be\nreduced by more than half, by the preparation of the product for use\nbefore it is shipped. If a coal community mined coal in Pennsylvania,\nand then sent it by railway to Michigan or Wisconsin to be screened, and\nthen hauled it back again to Pennsylvania for use, it would not be much\nsillier than the hauling of Texas beef alive to Chicago, there to be\nkilled, and then shipped back dead to Texas; or the hauling of Kansas\ngrain to Minnesota, there to be ground in the mills and hauled back\nagain as flour.

It does not suggest anything new; it suggests something that is\nvery old. This is the way the country did things before we fell into the\nhabit of carting everything around a few thousand miles and adding the\ncartage to the consumer's bill. Our communities ought to be more\ncomplete in themselves. They ought not to be unnecessarily dependent on\nrailway transportation. Out of what they produce they should supply\ntheir own needs and ship the surplus.

  "page-483": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">means, the cooperation of farmers can. The chief\ninjustice sustained by the farmer to-day is that, being the greatest\nproducer, he is prevented from being also the greatest merchandiser,\nbecause he is compelled to sell to those who put his products into\nmerchantable form. If he could change his grain into flour, his cattle\ninto beef, and his hogs into hams and bacon, not only would he receive\nthe fuller profit of his product, but he would render his near-by\ncommunities more independent of railway exigencies, and thereby improve\nthe transportation system by relieving it of the burden of his\nunfinished product.

I met\nhim first many years ago when I was with the Detroit Edison\nCompany—probably about 1887 or thereabouts. The electrical men held a\nconvention at Atlantic City, and Edison, as the leader in electrical\nscience, made an address. I was then working on my gasoline engine, and\nmost people, including all of my associates in the electrical company,\nhad taken pains to tell me that time spent on a gasoline engine was time\nwasted—that the power of the future</p>",
  "page-486": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was to be electricity. These\ncriticisms had not made any impression on me. I was working ahead with\nall my might. But being in the same room with Edison suggested to me\nthat it would be a good idea to find out if the master of electricity\nthought it was going to be the only power in the future. So, after Mr.\nEdison had finished his address, I managed to catch him alone for a\nmoment. I told him what I was working on.</p><p>At once he was interested. He is interested in every search for new\nknowledge. And then I asked him if he thought that there was a future\nfor the internal combustion engine. He answered something in this\nfashion:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Yes, there is a big future for any light-weight engine that can develop\na high horsepower and be self-contained. No one kind of motive power is\never going to do all the work of the country. We do not know what\nelectricity can do, but I take for granted that it cannot</p>",
  "page-487": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">do everything.</p><p>Keep on with your engine. If you can get what you are after, I can see a\ngreat future.</p><p>That is characteristic of Edison. He was the central figure in the\nelectrical industry, which was then young and enthusiastic. The rank and\nfile of the electrical men could see nothing ahead but electricity, but\ntheir leader could see with crystal clearness that no one power could do\nall the work of the country. I suppose that is why he was the leader.</p><p>Such was my first meeting with Edison. I did not see him again until\nmany years after—until our motor had been developed and was in\nproduction. He remembered perfectly our first meeting. Since then we\nhave seen each other often. He is one of my closest friends, and we\ntogether have swapped many an idea.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">His knowledge is almost universal. He is interested in every conceivable\nsubject and he recognizes no</p>",
  "page-488": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">limitations. He believes that all things\nare possible. At the same time he keeps his feet on the ground. He goes\nforward step by step. He regards \"impossible\" as a description for that\nwhich we have not at the moment the knowledge to achieve. He knows that\nas we amass knowledge we build the power to overcome the impossible.\nThat is the rational way of doing the \"impossible.\" The irrational way\nis to make the attempt without the toil of accumulating knowledge. Mr.\nEdison is only approaching the height of his power. He is the man who is\ngoing to show us what chemistry really can do. For he is a real\nscientist who regards the knowledge for which he is always searching as\na tool to shape the progress of the world. He is not the type of\nscientist who merely stores up knowledge and turns his head into a\nmuseum. Edison is easily the world's greatest scientist. I am not sure\nthat he is not also the world's worst business man. He knows almost\nnothing</p>",

I like the outdoors. I like to walk\nacross country and jump fences. We have five hundred bird houses on the\nfarm. We call them our bird hotels, and one of them, the Hotel\nPontchartrain—a martin house—has seventy-six apartments. All winter\nlong we have wire baskets of food hanging about on the trees and then\nthere is a big basin in which the water is kept from freezing by an\nelectric heater. Summer and winter, food, drink, and shelter are on hand\nfor the birds. We have hatched pheasants and quail in incubators and\nthen turned them over to electric brooders. We have all kinds of bird\nhouses and nests. The sparrows, who are great abusers of hospitality,\ninsist that their nests be immovable—that they do not sway in the wind;\nthe wrens like swaying nests. So we mounted a number of wren boxes on\nstrips</p>",
  "page-490": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">of spring steel so that they would sway in the wind. The wrens\nliked the idea and the sparrows did not, so we have been able to have\nthe wrens nest in peace. In summer we leave cherries on the trees and\nstrawberries open in the beds, and I think that we have not only more\nbut also more different kinds of bird callers than anywhere else in the\nnorthern states. John Burroughs said he thought we had, and one day when\nhe was staying at our place he came across a bird that he had never seen\nbefore.</p><p>About ten years ago we imported a great number of birds from\nabroad—yellow-hammers, chaffinches, green finches, red pales, twites,\nbullfinches, jays, linnets, larks—some five hundred of them. They\nstayed around a while, but where they are now I do not know. I shall not\nimport any more. Birds are entitled to live where they want to live.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Birds are the best of companions. We need them for</p>",
  "page-491": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">their beauty and\ntheir companionship, and also we need them for the strictly economic\nreason that they destroy harmful insects. The only time I ever used the\nFord organization to influence legislation was on behalf of the birds,\nand I think the end justified the means. The Weeks-McLean Bird Bill,\nproviding for bird sanctuaries for our migratory birds, had been hanging\nin Congress with every likelihood of dying a natural death. Its\nimmediate sponsors could not arouse much interest among the Congressmen.\nBirds do not vote. We got behind that bill and we asked each of our six\nthousand dealers to wire to his representative in Congress. It began to\nbecome apparent that birds might have votes; the bill went through. Our\norganization has never been used for any political purpose and never\nwill be. We assume that our people have a right to their own\npreferences.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">To get back to John Burroughs. Of course I knew</p>",
  "page-492": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">who he was and I had\nread nearly everything he had written, but I had never thought of\nmeeting him until some years ago when he developed a grudge against\nmodern progress. He detested money and especially he detested the power\nwhich money gives to vulgar people to despoil the lovely countryside. He\ngrew to dislike the industry out of which money is made. He disliked the\nnoise of factories and railways. He criticized industrial progress, and\nhe declared that the automobile was going to kill the appreciation of\nnature. I fundamentally disagreed with him. I thought that his emotions\nhad taken him on the wrong tack and so I sent him an automobile with the\nrequest that he try it out and discover for himself whether it would not\nhelp him to know nature better. That automobile—and it took him some\ntime to learn how to manage it himself—completely changed his point of\nview. He found that it helped him to see more, and from the time of\ngetting it,</p>",
  "page-493": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">he made nearly all of his bird-hunting expeditions behind\nthe steering wheel. He learned that instead of having to confine himself\nto a few miles around Slabsides, the whole countryside was open to him.</p><p>Out of that automobile grew our friendship, and it was a fine one. No\nman could help being the better for knowing John Burroughs. He was not a\nprofessional naturalist, nor did he make sentiment do for hard research.\nIt is easy to grow sentimental out of doors; it is hard to pursue the\ntruth about a bird as one would pursue a mechanical principle. But John\nBurroughs did that, and as a result the observations he set down were\nvery largely accurate. He was impatient with men who were not accurate\nin their observations of natural life. John Burroughs first loved nature\nfor its own sake; it was not merely his stock of material as a\nprofessional writer. He loved it before he wrote about it.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Late in life he turned philosopher. His philosophy</p>",
  "page-494": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">was not so much a\nphilosophy of nature as it was a natural philosophy—the long, serene\nthoughts of a man who had lived in the tranquil spirit of the trees. He\nwas not pagan; he was not pantheist; but he did not much divide between\nnature and human nature, nor between human nature and divine. John\nBurroughs lived a wholesome life. He was fortunate to have as his home\nthe farm on which he was born. Through long years his surroundings were\nthose which made for quietness of mind. He loved the woods and he made\ndusty-minded city people love them, too—he helped them see what he saw.\nHe did not make much beyond a living. He could have done so, perhaps,\nbut that was not his aim. Like another American naturalist, his\noccupation could have been described as inspector of birds' nests and\nhillside paths. Of course, that does not pay in dollars and cents.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">When he had passed the three score and ten he changed his views on\nindustry. Perhaps I had something</p>",
  "page-495": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">to do with that. He came to see that\nthe whole world could not live by hunting birds' nests. At one time in\nhis life, he had a grudge against all modern progress, especially where\nit was associated with the burning of coal and the noise of traffic.\nPerhaps that was as near to literary affectation as he ever came.\nWordsworth disliked railways too, and Thoreau said that he could see\nmore of the country by walking. Perhaps it was influences such as these\nwhich bent John Burroughs for a time against industrial progress. But\nonly for a time. He came to see that it was fortunate for him that\nothers' tastes ran in other channels, just as it was fortunate for the\nworld that his taste ran in its own channel. There has been no\nobservable development in the method of making birds' nests since the\nbeginning of recorded observation, but that was hardly a reason why\nhuman beings should not prefer modern sanitary homes to cave dwellings.\nThis was a part of John Burroughs's</p>",
  "page-496": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">sanity—he was not afraid to change\nhis views. He was a lover of Nature, not her dupe. In the course of time\nhe came to value and approve modern devices, and though this by itself\nis an interesting fact, it is not so interesting as the fact that he\nmade this change after he was seventy years old. John Burroughs was\nnever too old to change. He kept growing to the last. The man who is too\nset to change is dead already. The funeral is a mere detail.</p><p>If he talked more of one person than another, it was Emerson. Not only\ndid he know Emerson by heart as an author, but he knew him by heart as a\nspirit.

But afterward he found his own way—which for him\nwas better.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">There was no sadness in John Burroughs's death.

Without a profit, business\ncannot extend.
